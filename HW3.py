# import the random module for use in this program

# Create the class Fortune_Teller
    # create the constructor (__init__) method
    # it takes as input: a list of possible answers
    # it sets this object's fortunes_list (instance variable) to the passed list of possible answers
    # it sets this object's questions_list (instance variable) to an empty list
    # it sets this object's fortunes_history_list (instance variable) to an empty list
    

    # create the __str__ method
    # It should return a string with all the fortunes
    # in fortunes_list separated by commas
    # For example : "Yes, No, Not clear"

    # create the get_fortune method
    # it randomly picks an index from 0 to the number of items in the fortunes_list minus one
    # it adds that index to the end of the fortunes_history_list
    # it returns the answer at the picked index

    # create the question_check method that takes a question
    # it checks if the question is in the questions_list and if so returns
    #         "I've already answered that question”
    # Otherwise it adds the question to the questions_list and
    # returns the fortune from get_fortune

    # create the print_questions_history method
    # prints "[answer index] question - answer" for each of the indices in the fortunes_history_list
    # from the first to the last with each on a separate line.  If there are no items in the
    # fortunes_history_list it prints "None yet"
    # it does not return anything!

    # EXTRA POINTS
    # create the most_frequent method
    # it takes as input:
    #   a number, n. Ex: 200
    # it generates a random response n times by calling get_fortune
    # It prints the counts for each answer and
    # prints the most frequently occurring answer (Do not use a dictionary in this solution):
    #   Yes: 36
    #   No: 36
    #   Ask again: 48
    #   Maybe: 38
    #   Not clear: 47
    #   The most frequent answer after 200 was Not clear

    # You are welcome to replace the answer_list with your desired answers

    # get the first question or quit

    # loop while question is not "quit"

        # get an answer from question_check

        # print question - answer
